# hello-world
# This file is used as an readme.md for the first repository I created on github. Hints and tips ar welcome.
# See how this will gone work.

#  A bit about myself: I am a software enngineer since multiple years, but only in touch with other software version tools like PTC or SVN. Thus I decided to learn a bit more about git. From my point of view this is very similiar to the scense of github. This Is why I try Github aswell.
